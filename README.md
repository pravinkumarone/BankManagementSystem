## Getting Started

## Folder Structure

The workspace contains two folders by default, where:

- `src`: the folder to maintain sources
- `src\Icons`: the folder contains icons
- `lib`: the folder to maintain dependencies

Meanwhile, the compiled output files will be generated in the `bin` folder by default.

> This project requires a SQL DBMS like PostgreSQL or MySQL to maintain all records like login, signup, and transactions.
